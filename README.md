Be able to perform sync without opening foobar2000

Be able to work on my Galaxy S3 with PowerAmp

CLI for simple use
Copies fpl playlists with given names and their contained files to indicated
directory.  Playlists copied as m3u8 files with relative pathnames.  Files
copied in order until space runs out in the target directory.

Reusable python package for more complex scripts
e.g. Copy playlist A, then copy random songs from playlist B until space
runs out in the target directory
